# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# db/seeds.rb
#puts "Cleaning database..."
#Activity.destroy_all

#pizza_east =  { name: "Pizza East", address: "56A Shoreditch High St, London E1 6PQ", stars: 4 }

#[ dishoom, pizza_east ].each do |attributes|
